# Number guessing game python version and jac version

-  Classes are declared with obj and methods with def. 
-  Statements end with a semicolon and the parent initializer is invoked via super.init. 
- Program execution happens inside a with entry { ... } block, which replaces Python's if __name__ == "__main__": section. 


### Step 2:
### Declaring fields with has
- Fields may specify types and default values directly on the declaration. 
- Methods that take no parameters omit parentheses in their signature, making the object definition concise.

### Step 3:
## Separating implementation with impl
- The object lists method signatures (def init;, override def play;), and the actual bodies are provided later in impl Class.method blocks. This separation keeps the interface clean and helps organise larger codebases.

### Step 4 
## Walking the graph
- Finally guess_game4.jac re‑imagines the game using Jac's object‑spatial architecture. 
- A walker visits a chain of turn nodes created with ++> edges. 
- The walker moves with visit [-->] and stops via disengage when the guess is correct. 
- The game is launched by spawning the walker at root. This example shows how conventional logic can become graph traversal.

### step 5
## Scale Agnostic Approach
- The same code that runs locally can seamlessly scale to cloud deployment without modification.
- By running the command jac serve filename.jac, the walkers become API endpoints that can be called via HTTP requests. This shows how Jac applications are inherently cloud-ready.

### step 6
##  AI-Enhanced Gameplay with byLLM
- The final version integrates AI capabilities using byLLM (Meaning Typed LLM)
- Instead of simple "too high" or "too low" responses, the game now provides intelligent, context-aware hints generated by an LLM. This demonstrates how easily AI can be woven into Jac applications to create more engaging user
